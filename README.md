# qml-cutensornet

Code for our experiments on Quantum Kernel methods being simulated on NVIDIA GPUs via pytket-cutensornet.

The Elliptic Bitcoin Dataset needs to be downloaded and stored in the folder ``elliptic_bitcoin_dataset``. The two files should be ``elliptic_txs_classes.csv`` and ``elliptic_txs_features.csv``.
